## Original Readme
sleepyti.me is a Javascript/jQuery based bedtime calculator that helps you decide when
to go to sleep. It works by counting backwards in 90-minute sleep cycles so
that you wake up refreshed and alert (instead of tired and groggy).

The main website can be viewed at http://sleepyti.me, or by viewing the "raw
source" of this github project.
